Mass generate multiple Pages using dynamic content.

== Description ==

Page Generator is a mass page generator (sometimes called a bulk page generator or bulk post generator) that creates multiple pages in bulk.

To produce unique multiple page generator variations, <a href="https://www.wpzinc.com/documentation/page-generator-pro/keywords/">keywords</a> are used in the Plugin's content.

Each keyword contains the data you want - such as names, locations, services.  Page Generator will then create your WordPress Pages accordingly, saving you time vs. manually creating Pages one by one.

=== Usage ===

Page Generator can be used as a mass page creator or bulk post generator for any type of WordPress Pages, including:
- Landing Pages, with service and location details (e.g. Web Design in New York, Web Design in London, Web Development in New York, Web Development in London etc)
- Personalised Pages e.g. name-specific award/certificate pages
- Individual Specific Pages
- Producing real world placeholder content for testing Themes and Plugins with specific HTML / Blocks / Layout combinations across multiple WordPress Pages

=== Methods ===

Each keyword contain multiple words or phrases that are then cycled through for each Page that is generated depending on the chosen <a href="https://www.wpzinc.com/documentation/page-generator-pro/generate-methods/">method</a>:
- All: Generates Pages for all possible unique combinations of terms across all keywords used.
- Sequential: Honors the order of terms in each keyword used. Once all terms have been used in a keyword, the generator stops.

=== Full Control ===

Made a mistake in your mass generated content or Keywords? Page Generator can trash or delete its generated pages, allowing you to generate them again.

You can also limit the number of pages to generate, and Test mode generates a single page in draft mode to preview the results before full mass page generation.
